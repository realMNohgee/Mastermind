##### Things that I need to do for Mastermind game ######
# Lay out rules of engagement (rules for the game) #
# Make sure to assume the computer is the one to randomly select the 4 digit number (Just at first) #
# Let player choose to be codebreaker (the one to guess the code) #
# Or let player choose to be the code chooser (person who chooses 4 colors or numbers) #
# Make sure the program gives the proper feedback (if correct and in the right spot or if just correct) to the codebreaker #
# Something to figure out if the game has been completed successfully #
# Give message at end for either winning or loosing player #
# After getting game to work, go back and make so computer makes choice on who does what role #
# Try to implement a strategy for the computer to follow #
